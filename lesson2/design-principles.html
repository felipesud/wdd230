                games-workshop.com is a sight to order gaming models. The website
                applys Hick's law by using images, filters, and stylized logo's. it
                easier to select what you want with filters to sort the products and
                every product has an image that shows you exactly what you will be
                getting.

                Forgeworld follows the Rule of Thirds principle with all of it's
                images. It is a site that sells models and the best way to do that is
                to show the model.

                <p>
                  ChurchofJesusChrist.org has a very clean look to it. There is proper
                  spacing so that there is a lot of content but it does not feel
                  cluttered or disorganized, nor do I feel overwhelmed when looking
                  through the content.
