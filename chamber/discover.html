          <p>This is the most important sector of the city's economy. It developed a lot during the late 60's, throughout the 70's and in the early 80's, following the growing rhythm of the national economy.  From the year 1996, new heating appeared with the installation of new industries.</p>

          <h4 class="Scaption">Agriculture and Livestock</h4>
          <p>This activity is still of notable importance in the daily life of the municipality. The main product is milk, one of the largest in the Vale do Paraíba dairy basin. About 75% of the herd is destined for dairy production, which is mostly destined for processing plants in the region, although there is already an initiative to process it by some producers. Of the agricultural activities, rice cultivation in drained and systematized floodplains stands out, followed by sugarcane, potato, beans, and corn.</p>

          <h4 class="Xcaption">Business and Services</h4>
          <p>Despite having a reasonable industrial park, trade and service activities in Caçapava can be considered developing, having as justification for this, the proximity to municipalities such as São José dos Campos and Taubaté, which are major attractions for the installation of Shopping Centers and Hypermarkets, as well as a greater variety of Services.</p>

          <h4 class="Dcaption">Tourism</h4>
          <p>The great tourist potential of the municipality lies in the practice of Ecotourism, Historic-Cultural, and Rural segments.

            In the municipality, there is the Mirante da Pedra Branca Trail and the ‘‘Vorta Fria’’ Trail or Tropeiro Route. These are circuits where tourists can travel the century-old path made by drovers in the 19th century, contemplating landscaped scenes at high altitudes or even visiting mansions from the coffee cycle.</p>

          <p>The city's motto is "Mea autem Brasiliae magnitudo" which means "My greatness is also that of Brazil". This representation is in the army battalion based in the municipality that is highlighted for its performance in the world. In its structure, it houses the Military Museum which presents in its collection objects that tell the trajectory of the country in the main wars and armed interventions that the group participated in in the world.</p>

          <p>Another highlight in the area of museums is the Roberto Lee Museum of Antique Racing, which gave the city the title of National Capital of Antique Racing for having the only collection of antique cars listed by COMDEPHAACT in the State of São Paulo, and for being this museum, the pioneer in the segment, in Latin America.</p>

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>The name of the municipality originates from the Tupi language and means clearing or "passage in the forest", from ka'a, "forest" and asapaba, "passage". Probably, the name was given due to the large natural crevice that exists in the Serra do Mar in this region and which is responsible for the dense fogs coming from the Atlantic Ocean in the winter period.</p>
  
        <p>Caçapava emerged through two different nuclei. The oldest nucleus, which today is the neighborhood of Vila Velha de Caçapava, was a village that grew up around the Nossa Senhora d'Ajuda chapel, built in 1705 on the land of a farm belonging to Jorge Dias Velho and landing place of the path. Real that connected the municipalities of São Paulo and Taubaté.</p>
        <p>Caçapava Velha (as the village is known today) was elevated to parish status on March 18, 1813 with the name Cassapaba parish. Today's Caçapava appeared in 1842, the year in which a chapel dedicated to Saint John the Baptist was built. The village was founded by Captain João Ramos da Silva and became the parish seat. On May 3, 1850, it was elevated to the category of village, becoming a municipality on April 14, 1855.</p>
        <p>After coffee at the end of the 19th century, a period of economic stagnation followed. The recovery only took place in the mid-20th century with the cultivation of rice and the introduction of dairy farming, and it accelerated in the 1970s with the expansion of industrial activities in the municipality.</p>
